  <p >Spider-Man is a fictional character that first appeared in Marvel Comics and is now apart of the MCU(Marvel Cinematic Universe). He was created by Stan Lee(writer) and Steve Ditko(artist). 
    He is arguably the most popular character in the MCU and is well-known arounfd the world. Spider-Man has always been my favorite superhero growing up. I love his story and think his character is amazing. I always enjoyed watching Spider-Man cartoons growing up. The movies are spectacular too, seeing him fight against so many of his iconic enemies. </p>

  <h2>Origins</h2>
  <p>Spider-Man's real name is Peter Parker. He got bitten by a radioactive spider when he was in highschool. He had no intentions of becoming a superhero until his Uncle Ben was killed. His Uncle always had a saying: "With great power, comes great responsibility". Peter lives by these words as he swings around New York City and uses his incredible powers for good.</p>
